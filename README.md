# Clothing-company-sales-analysis

The fashion industry is a continuously evolving industry as trends keep changing among the customers at a frequent rate, with a demand for new styles or types of clothing and fashionwear. This creates a demand on the brands to keep updating their catalogues with the lastest clothing. All of this has a direct impact on the sales of the brand and hence this project focuses on finding insights as to how all of these different factors such as the category of clothing, the season in which it was bought and other important details affect the sales of a fashion brand.
